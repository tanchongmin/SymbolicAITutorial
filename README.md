This repository contains the potential usage of the SymbolicAI architecture.

Symbolic AI defines everything as a symbol, with some symbols storing information, 
and some symbols are like expressions used to evaluate the symbols to get information.

Each symbol is basically stored in text form. 
There are basic operations already defined that enable you to do translation (translate), classification (choice), compose text (compose), do question answer (query). 
If you want to customize your own, you can use expressions to do any text-based instruction to the symbol. 
Furthermore, if you want even more flexibility, you can simply use an LLM-based function, just like in Wolfram-Alpha!

More in the future:
- Chatbot
- Interfacing with Pinecone, Wolfram Alpha, Whispr APIs
